Planning

Many people would say in order to have a good plan; you need to write out all vibrant details. A good plan needs lots of details, they said. But in real life, where nothing is certain and is filled with sudden surprises, a good plan should prioritize its flexibility and simplicity.

Start with the main goals of the week, then expand on the actual required actions to achieve those desired goals. Always remember to add in extra 2 hours of standby in between early morning and noon to have space for the urgent work. In those days when those free 2 hours were not needed, use it to review the past works or a quick investment time to catch up with the progress of the fast-pace tech world. 

Lastly, being neat always help in many cases. It helps one to maintain the transparency in the work and can ensure that they will not miss out on anything.
